This reei of microfiim contains materiai
which itas paper ooior changes, stains, or
illustratione, (some of which may appear on
paqes mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure that aii text and illustrations are ys
legitote, exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore, when text anci illustratione exist
in a single image or when materiai
bacquounds differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure refieots tite camera
operator’s best effort to capture the majority
of the text; the second exposure reflects the

camera operator’s best effort to capture
iliustrative materiai or tite remaining text. it

is hoped that titis practice witi resuit in a
microfiim produot that fuiiy serves the needs

of most researchers.
